          A lowboy trailer is a low platform flatbed trailer used to haul heavy,
          bulky and taller than normal items. They have carry capacities of 25
          tons (50,000 pounds) & 35 tons (70,000 pounds). A lowboy trailer is an
          excellent choice for hauling construction equipment, agricultural
          machinery and other heavy-duty loads.

          Fuel tank trailers are built to hold liquids and dry materials for
          easy, safe transportation. They can transport a range of cargo, from
          milk to hazardous chemicals. The tank may be divided into different
          sections by partitions, allowing drivers to carry different materials
          in the same load.

          A flatbed trailer is a typical open deck equipment that has no roof
          nor sides. It is mainly used for transporting heavy, oversized, wide
          and indelicate goods such as machinery, building supplies or
          equipment. The flatly shaped body makes it much easier to load and
          unload goods.

          Double drop
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-8">
          Double drop trailers are designed to carry taller loads because their
          cargo bed can go as low as 18 inches off the ground. This adds a
          considerable amount to your height clearance. Having a lower center
          means the center of gravity is also lower, which makes it safer than
          standard flatbeds.
