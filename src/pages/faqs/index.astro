          <p class="font-serif">
            Understanding auto transport insurance is important and we think
            it is valuable to explain how it works. As part of providing a great
            car transport service, it is our job to guarantee that the carrier
            we assign to pickup your vehicle is licensed and insured.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you go with Cayad to ship your vehicle, you can rest assured that
            the carrier assigned to move your car is fully insured and licensed with
            the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier and Safety Administration).
            <br />
            <br />
            Your vehicle is covered by the carriers insurance policy that is doing
            the shipping. Depending on the type and size of the truck/trailer that
            is shipping your car, the insurance policy can cover from $100,000 to
            $1,000,000 of damage.
            <br />
            <br />

            to explain what you need to do at both pickup and delivery in case there

            be taken care of.

            It is rare but, time-to-time there may be accidental damage while in

            <p class="mt-4 font-serif">
              We feel it is important for you to know how we determined your
              quote. Quotes are based on what the market demands for cars to be
              moved at a given time. Each quote is compared with the current
              rates on the National Load Board before being sent to our
              customers and will be reviewed periodically through the process.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 font-serif">
              Other companies might offer you a lower price to obtain your
              business. This method is ineffective because if the customer
              offers a below-market rate, it will run the probability of not
              getting loaded or transported on time.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 font-serif">
              Truck drivers always take the loads that pay the most first,
              leaving the loads that are mispriced to be moved last or not at
              all.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 font-serif">
              We try very hard to avoid this with our customers by quoting a
              fair but realistic quote up front.

          >
            <p class="font-serif">
              We do not collect a deposit from you until your car is actually
              assigned to be picked up by a reputable driver for a price you
              approve. However, we do take your credit card information before
              we begin to work on finding you a carrier.
              <br />
              <br />
              We do this because it is very common for customers to “double book”
              with multiple brokers thinking this will give them a better shot at
              getting their vehicle dispatched.
              <br />
              <br />
              In fact, all brokers are using the same resources to find a carrier
              for your vehicle. So when a car is “double booked” it only delays the
              process and confuses the carriers who are searching for their next
              vehicle to pick up on their route.
              <br />
              <br />
              By taking your information in advance, it allows us to work on finding
              you a driver in good faith for our efforts.
              <br />
              <br />
              If we fail to find you a carrier at a price you are comfortable with
              there are NO CANCELLATION FEES and your card will NOT be charged. We
              only ask that you let us work on getting you the best carrier at the
              best price present their offers to you.
              <br />
              <br />
              By giving us the assurance of your credit or debit card, we will do
              the best job possible to get you picked up on the dates you request
              for the price you want by a reputable carrier.
              <br />
              <br />
              We do not get paid until you get a driver dispatched to ship your vehicle,
              so it is always in our interest to do the best job possible for you.

              When you are looking for a car shipping rate, you want to understand
              how auto transport works.

              <br />
              <br />
              Prices are based on seasonal market demands for cars to be moved at
              any given time. Each quote is prepared based on the season and the
              current national rates.

              the right broker is vital to getting a reputable carrier for the lowest

              Cayad does a thorough background check with each carrier for every
              shipment. We verify their ratings, references, and in addition, we
              obtain a certified copy of their insurance certificate, directly from
              the government agency that it is on file with.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can have peace of mind knowing that the carrier shipping your vehicle

              This sometimes makes it impossible to reach many residential

              attempt to get as close as possible to your delivery location. We
              can also arrange a convenient location, like a shopping center, to

              If you are shopping around for the best price to ship your vehicle,
              it is likely that all of the quotes you are getting, including
              ours, are from brokers.

            <p class="mt-4 font-serif">
              Brokers do not own the trucks; we locate them for you according to
              your route, schedule, and budget.

            <p class="mt-4 font-serif">
              Every quote from a brokerage like ourselves, includes a broker fee
              and a carrier fee. Most broker fees are a fixed rate and vary from
              each company.

            <p class="mt-4 font-serif">
              They do not have the time or resources to find customers, and they

            <p class="mt-4 font-serif">
              Carriers run on specific routes and search for vehicles that need
              transporting along the routes they service; as such, there are
              thousands of carriers out there transporting across thousands of
              routes.

            <p class="font-serif">
              Quote providers are companies that operate primarily on the
              internet and advertise for us brokers. When you fill out their
              form on their website your information will be sent to anywhere
              from 5-12 brokers, just like us, who will look at your
              information, calculate a quote and then e-mail it to you and maybe
              call you, if you provided your telephone number.
              <br />
              <br />
              Most brokers rely on auto transport quote providers for a majority
              of their business; our website is here as an additional resource for
              our customers, but most of our customers find us through one of the
              online quote providers that we work with to find customers. They are
              usually a customers first stop when looking for auto transporters.
