        <h3 class="text-3xl mt-4 font-semibold">Distance</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mt-4">
          Total distance is the main component used in calculating a quote for
          car shipping. Longer distances generally lead to a higher overall car
          shipping price, but also include a discounted cost per mile. With our
          car shipping calculator, you can get the best auto transport quote for
          any car shipment. Itâ€™s important to note that international car
          shipping prices might differ from ground vehicle transport.

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-4">Shipping date</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mt-4">
          When you book a car transport service, the shipment date often plays a
          role in the cost. Itâ€™s best to book your car shipment as far in
          advance as possible. As soon as you know youâ€™ll need to ship your
          vehicle, begin researching an auto transport company to request a car
          shipping quote. Additionally, increased flexibility around car pickup
          dates will often result in car transport quote savings.

        <p class="text-sm mt-4">
          Different from distance, route refers to what highways and other roads
          will be traveled to transport the vehicle. Routes in highly populated
          areas may have increased traffic congestion, which could impact
          transport time and shipping costs. Additional route considerations
          that can be factored into shipping costs include: physical road
          conditions, adverse weather and road construction.

        <p class="text-sm mt-4">
          When planning your auto transport, we ask for the exact vehicle
          specifications, because the truck driver must know how much space is
          required to safely secure your automobile and ensure proper trailer
          height and side clearance. Longer and taller cars require additional
          vehicle transport adjustments, which may slightly increase car
          shipping costs. Vehicle modifications like larger tires and roof racks
          can also increase the cost.

          Taller, longer and heavier vehicles may require a specific trailer or

          need certain accommodations, like being transported in a specific
          place within the trailer. Both of these situations could require the
          driver to take fewer or smaller vehicles to accommodate special
          requests and manage total allowable weight limits.

          If your car is running, you will get a better auto shipping price from
          car shippers for the allotted distance. If your car is inoperable, but
          maintains the ability to roll, steer and brake, it will require a
          winch and other accommodations to be loaded onto the carrier trailer,
          which will increase the cost of shipment. To request a quote or to
          arrange shipment for an inoperable vehicle, please contact a Cayad

          vehicle ground clearance requires special attention and accommodation,
          such as a specialized ramp. If ground clearance is four inches or
          less, the vehicle must be shipped in an enclosed trailer equipped with
          a lift gate, which open trailers do not have.

          Most people shipping a car select open car transport, as it is the
          industry standard and cheapest way for car shippers to move your
          vehicle. For extra car shipment protection, we recommend using
          enclosed car transportation services that shield vehicles from weather
          and debris. Enclosed auto transport can increase the cost of car
          shipping, but is worth the peace of mind for delicate, exotic or
          luxury car transportation.

        <p class="text-sm mt-4">
          Car shipping costs vary greatly based on the time of year. For
          example, auto transport services to warmer states are very popular
          during the winter travel season, so the cost for transporting a car to
          those destinations may be higher. Use Cayadâ€™s car shipping calculator
          to get the price for shipping a car. Depending on your scheduling
          flexibility, we recommend trying different shipping dates to see rate
          impact for choosing the best price.

            Auto transport companies are held to stringent insurance

            transport brokers can inform you of your carrierâ€™s amount of
            coverage. When determining insurance coverage, ask your Cayad
