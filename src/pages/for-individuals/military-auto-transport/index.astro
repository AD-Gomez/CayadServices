          Military PCS vehicle shipping is entitled to certain members assigned
          to a new duty station. Only one privately owned vehicle (POV) may be
          shipped at government expense, according to the Department of Defense.
          Alternate port requests must get approval from the Military Traffic
          Management Command (MTMC).
