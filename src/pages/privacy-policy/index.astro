      Analytics to help us understand how our Site is used. To opt-out of the sale
      of Personal Data by Cayad, you may go to Cayads “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal
      Information” web page. Cayad does not have actual knowledge that we sell or
      share Personal Data about minors under the age of 16.

      Your Personal Data may be collected, transferred to and stored by us in
      the United States and by our affiliates in other countries where we
      operate. Therefore, your Personal Data may be processed outside the
      European Economic Area (EEA), and in countries which are not subject to an
      adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not provide for
      the same level of data protection as the EEA. In this event, we will
      ensure that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level
      of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses
      for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46
      GDPR), or we will ask you for your prior consent to such international
      data transfers.
