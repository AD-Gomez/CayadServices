## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

## Quote Flow (Leads Quality Update)

The `/quote` page now uses a new multi-step estimator flow designed to reduce low-intent ("junk") leads:

- Step 1: Origin and destination (city or ZIP, validated via autocomplete)
- Step 2: Vehicle type (sedan/coupe/suv/pickup/van/motorcycle) + trailer (Open/Enclosed)
- Step 3: Immediate estimated price, assumptions, and insights; options to request exact quote or to be contacted
- Step 4 (Exact path): Vehicle year/make/model + running status
- Step 5: Contact details and preferred pickup date

Key files:
- `src/components/forms/EstimatorQuote.tsx`: main UI flow
- `src/utils/priceEstimator.ts`: heuristic price estimator (distance bands + multipliers)
- `src/services/distance.ts`: geocoding & distance helpers + ETA window

Notes:
- Estimate assumes Open and runs/drives by default; choosing Enclosed adjusts pricing.
- Lead submission uses `sendLeadToLanding` and redirects to `/quote2`.
- To revert, swap the import in `src/pages/quote/index.astro` back to `FormQuote`.
